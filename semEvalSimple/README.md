CHATGPT SUBTASK2 BASELINE EXPLANATION:

This code appears to be a script for training and evaluating a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for a specific task, likely related to natural language processing. Here is a breakdown of the code's method and goal:

Methods:

1. Tokenization and Labeling:

The code tokenizes input sentences and assigns labels to each token based on antecedent and consequence information.
Antecedent and consequence information is extracted from the provided training dataset.

2. Feature Extraction:

Features are extracted from the tokenized sentences to create a feature list for each word.
Features include word information (lowercase, last three letters, last two letters, uppercase, title case, digit), part-of-speech tag, and context features of neighboring words.

3. CRF Model Training:

The script uses the pycrfsuite library to train a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model.
The training data consists of sentences with labeled tokens.

4. Prediction:

The trained CRF model is used to predict labels for tokens in the test dataset.

5. Evaluation Metrics:

The script calculates precision, recall, F1-score, and exact match metrics for the predicted labels compared to the ground truth labels.

6. Goal:
The goal of this code is to train a CRF model to predict antecedent and consequence information for tokens in sentences. The model is then evaluated on a test dataset using precision, recall, F1-score, and exact match metrics. The task appears to involve identifying antecedent and consequence spans within sentences.

Please note that specific details about the task, such as the nature of antecedent and consequence information or the dataset, are not provided in the code. Understanding the task requires additional information outside the provided code snippet.
